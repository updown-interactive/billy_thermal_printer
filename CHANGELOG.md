## 2.0.1

* Fixed BLE discovery to also include system-connected devices using `getSystemDevices()`.
* Fixed BLE reconnect behavior so connection state updates correctly when reconnecting from system Bluetooth settings.
* Added BLE connection-state synchronization and listener management to keep `devicesStream` in sync after disconnect/reconnect cycles.
* Updated BLE scan initialization to honor Android fine-location permission settings through platform scan config.

## 2.0.0

* **Major Refactoring & Code Quality Improvements**
  - Fixed all linting and static analysis issues across the project.
  - Improved null safety and type safety in `Printer` and `PrinterManager`.
  - Refactored `Printer` class to correctly handle name overrides and data sanitization.
  - Fixed Windows stub implementation for better cross-platform compatibility.

* **Documentation**
  - Added comprehensive DartDoc comments for all public methods in `BillyThermalPrinter` and `PrinterManager`.
  - Documented all parameters including `chunkSize`, `connectionStabilizationDelay`, and others.

* **Testing**
  - Fixed and updated unit tests to ensure reliability Thanks to `@LosDanieloss`.
  - Verified behavior of `Printer` class serialization and initialization.

## 1.2.4

  - Android/iOS: Optimized BLE scanning with better subscription management
  - All Platforms: Improved USB printer detection and management

* **New Features**
  - `copyWith()` method for immutable Printer updates
  - `uniqueId` property for better printer identification
  - `hasValidConnectionData` validation method
  - Enhanced connection type validation
  - Comprehensive toString() and equality implementations

* **Breaking Changes**
  - Printer class fields are now final (immutable)
  - Use `copyWith()` for printer updates instead of direct field assignment
  - Some internal method signatures have changed for better error handling

* **Developer Experience**
  - Added OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md with detailed optimization explanations
  - Enhanced analysis_options.yaml with strict linting rules
  - Improved error messages for better debugging
