String? name;
ConnectionType? connectionType;
bool? isConnected;
String? vendorId;
String? productId;
```

## Additional Features

### Screenshot to Printer
Easily capture and print widgets as images using the `printWidget` method.

### Image Cropping for Long Prints
Handles long data by cropping images and printing them in chunks to ensure seamless printing on devices with limited buffer capacity.

### Connection Type Validation
- Ensures `ConnectionType` compatibility and alerts when unsupported combinations are used. 

### BLE State Monitoring
Provides real-time monitoring for Bluetooth states, ensuring proactive error handling and reconnections.

### BLE Connection Configuration
Customize BLE connection behavior to optimize for different printer models:

```dart
// Global configuration (applies to all BLE connections)
BillyThermalPrinter.instance.bleConfig =
    BleConfig(connectionStabilizationDelay: Duration(seconds: 3));

// Per-connection override for specific devices
await BillyThermalPrinter.instance.connect(
  printer,
  connectionStabilizationDelay: Duration(seconds: 2),
);

// Default behavior (10 seconds) - no configuration needed
await BillyThermalPrinter.instance.connect(printer);
```

| Configuration | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|
| Global config | Set once for consistent behavior across all connections |
| Per-call override | Fine-tune for specific printer models that connect faster/slower |
| Default (10s) | Backwards compatible, works with most printers |

## Notes and Recommendations

- **Windows & MacOS Users:** Make sure you have the XPrinter driver installed on Windows for printer compatibility.  
  Download the driver from [XPrinter Driver](https://www.xprintertech.com/drivers-2.html).

- **Cross-Platform Usage:** Ensure Bluetooth permissions and configurations are set correctly for Android and iOS.
